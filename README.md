# New Relic IAST Formatter

This very rough prototype takes a YAML formatted New Relic APM agent configuration file as its input.  If you click on the Validate button, it validates the YAML per the standard syntax rules.  If you check the Enable IAST checkbox, it adds the settings required to enable the IAST capability.

To use it, clone the repo somewhere and open iast-formatter.html in your favorite browser.  Copy and paste your New Relic APM agent config into the text box and click on the button.
