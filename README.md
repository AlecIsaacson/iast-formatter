# New Relic IAST Formatter

This very rough prototype takes a YAML formatted New Relic APM agent configuration file as its input.  If you click on the Validate button, it validates the YAML per the standard syntax rules.  If you check the Enable IAST checkbox, it adds the settings required to enable the IAST capability.
